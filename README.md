# Visual explanation of features that influence popularity of pet images

In this paper, we explored the use of existing pre-trained deep neural network architectures (ResNet, VGG, DenseNet,and  EfficientNet)
for  transfer learningand  build  custom layers on top to include the metadata features in determining the popularity of pets (cats & dogs). 
We further use three different  saliency  maptechniques:  Vanilla  Gradient, GradCam  and  RISE, to  visually  explain  the  important features  of  the  petâ€™s  image.  
We  came  up  with  several hypotheses to interpret popularity among different images and using saliency maps, we presented evidence to confirm or reject the hypothesis.
